The fusion of music and gastronomy at Indian Trail High School's Beats and Eats Festival is set to create lasting memories, uniting the community in a celebration of art, culture, and the delightful convergence of diverse talents.</p>


<h2>How It Started</h2>
   <p>In the Winter of 2022, Former Indian Trail Band Director, Jeremy Kriedeman, had an idea that would unify the band community more and make the band program more fun. He thought hosting a festival at the school with local food trucks and more popular music instead of classical songs would help create a new and original concert compared to other high school band concerts. With the help of his students, he got the whole event planned out and designed which took 3 months to fully get done. Finally on March 15th 2023, the first Beats and Eats happened and it was a success with over 3x the estimated number,9,500 dollars being raised, and recognized in the Kenosha News as <strong><i>¨one of the most creative school performances in the district.¨</strong></i> Because of the success of this event, this has now became an annual tradition at our school and an event that many people of our community enjoy.</p>
